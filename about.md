I am a senior undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, majoring in *Mathematics and Computing*. My research interests mainly lie in perception and planning of autonomous mobile robots.

This summer I interned at the [iRoM Lab, Princeton University](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/). I worked on learning task-relevant features for robot controllers and making formal guarantees on their safety.

In summer 2017, I interned at [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/){:target="_blank"} where I worked on risk-aware probabilistic motion planning for future Mars Rovers including the [Mars 2020 Rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/){:target="_blank"}. 

In summer 2016, I interned at the [Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I worked on a new approach to obstacle avoidance using *only* stereo vision without the need for dense 3D reconstruction.

Currently I'm building autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of delivering medicinal supplies to rural regions of India with [Aerial Robotics Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/){:target="_blank"}. I'm also with [Technology Robotix Society](www.robotix.in){:target="_blank"} which aims to spread the culture of robotics in India through various events and workshops.

On most days I'm cheerful and friendly but I know all about pain and suffering being a religious [Arsenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZIcO06x6w){:target="_blank"} fan. Apart from football, I love playing table tennis and I captain my college's [table tennis team](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Table_Tennis){:target="_blank"}.
