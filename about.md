I'm a CVML Engineer at ï£¿ [Apple](https://youtu.be/TX9qSaGXFyg).

I completed my academic studies at the [Robotics Institute, CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} (MS in *Robotics*) and [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"} (M.Sc. in *Mathematics and Computing*).

I love playing table tennis and I'm proud to have represented CMUTTC and [IIT KGP](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Table_Tennis).

I also thoroughly enjoy watching [The Arsenal](https://youtu.be/vgiR0WYgZKg) (you might too).

My [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume.pdf) has more information about my experiences, and skills.
