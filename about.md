I am a first year PhD student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in *Mathematics and Computing* at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"}. I mainly work on Robotics and AI.

Last summer, I interned at the [IRoM Lab, Princeton University](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/). I worked on learning data-driven dynamic models of task-relevant perceptual features for robot controllers.

In summer 2017, I interned at [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/){:target="_blank"} where I worked on risk-aware probabilistic motion planning for the [Mars 2020](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/){:target="_blank"} and future Mars rovers.

In summer 2016, I interned at the [Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory, UMass Amherst](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I worked computationally efficient obstacle avoidance for ground robots using *only* stereo vision without the need for dense 3D reconstruction.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on building autonomous emergency drones capable of delivering medical supplies in remote, inaccessible areas of rural India with the [Aerial Robotics Lab, Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/){:target="_blank"}. I'm also with [Technology Robotix Society](www.robotix.in){:target="_blank"} which aims to spread the culture of robotics in India through various events and workshops.

On most days I'm cheerful and friendly, but I know all about pain and suffering being a religious [Arsenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZIcO06x6w){:target="_blank"} fan. Apart from football, I love playing table tennis, and I captained my college's [table tennis team](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Table_Tennis){:target="_blank"} from 2017-2019.
