I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in), majoring in *Mathematics and Computing*. My research interests mainly lie in perception and planning of autonomous mobile robots.

During summer 2017, I interned at [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). I worked on risk-aware probabilistic motion planning for future Mars Rovers which aims to reduce the conservatism of the present autonomous navigator of the [Mars 2020 Rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/).

In 2016, I was a summer intern at the [Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/). I worked on a new approach to obstacle avoidance using *only* stereo vision without the need for dense 3D reconstruction.

I am a religious follower of [Arsenal FC](http://www.arsenal.com/) and Robert Pires is my favorite footballer of all time! I love playing table tennis and am currently the captain of my college's table tennis team.

When I am free, I love to watch movies (Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson, and Christopher Nolan are my top three directors) and go out for beer!
