I am a Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Institute, CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} associated with the [Air Lab](http://theairlab.org/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in *Mathematics and Computing* from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"}.

On most days I'm cheerful and friendly, but I know all about pain and suffering being a religious [Arsenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZIcO06x6w){:target="_blank"} fan. Apart from football, I love playing table tennis, and I captained IIT KGP's [Table Tennis team](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Table_Tennis){:target="_blank"} from 2017-2019. Currently, I play for the CMU Table Tennis club.
